# Intro
 Much of the glamour around success is sensationalized partly because not many people know what #winning actually means (except you Charlie Sheen)
 
 # Winning
 In many of life’s games, you only have to be right once to win. Playing the game with the intention of winning every game is foolish & can
 
 # Examples
 1. Job search - You’re only going to work at 1 job. Unless you’re looking to maximize offers or your preference ranking, there’s diminishing returns for winning n+1 job offer
 
 2. Dating - If you’re doing it right, you’re only going to be with the “one”. Everything else is just a moral test.
 
 3. Secrets - Much of science & exploration is anchored on the belief that there are still many secrets still left to be uncovered. Like Thiel says, secrets will never seize to exist agnostic of their discovery or pursuit.
 
 4. Search - Much off conventional CS study centered around concepts of efficiency. Even with binary search, the goal is still to be right once — before you starve resources.
 
 # Mindset
 It’s liberating to know that to you can always stay #winning even if you lose 99 times. You got 99 outcomes, but a loss ain’t 1
