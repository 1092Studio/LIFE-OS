# LIFE-OS
A collection of mental models that are the operating system to my life

# Purpose
1. To share my way of thinking for inspiration & critique
2. To hold myself accountable and for the world to hold me accountable
3. To track how my principles & thinking change over time
4. To better motivate myself by working in public

# What it's not
1. A reflection of how I live my live perfectly: While aspirational, it's not realistic. I am a human being - trying, failing, & getting back up again.
2. A way for me to speak to you from a moral high ground: I write with ego but don't let that fool you, I don't know shit.
3. A prescriptive manual for the best & only way to do things: I'm still trying to figure things out and it'll take a lot of tries
