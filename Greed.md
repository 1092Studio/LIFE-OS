# Short-term greed v.s. long-term greed
Short term greed is the classical definition of greed. It's the kind of greed that leads you to optimize for short term results. On the other hand, long-term greed is the kind of greed that lets you play the game of life continously. After all, the true winners are not those who keep playing - it's the strategically dominant strategy. Being long-term greedy means you embrace the nature of greed but realize that your time horizon for when you want to cash-in is on the scale of 5-10 years for most goals. The decisions you make are more about creating opportunity than capturing value; two very separate goals with different inputs & time vectors for completion.
