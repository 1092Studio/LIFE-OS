# Intro
A common logical fallacy is constraining solution spaces to just a handful, maybe 3 or 4. As Edward De Bono says, there’s wisdom in expanding the realm of possibilities. When you push yourself to find 8 solutions, patterns & biases begin to crack to reveal novel solutions that question the status quo.

# Crazy 8s
In the design sprint methodology, a simple exercise known as Crazy 8s takes place early in the process to cultivate independent & fresh thinking. It’s simple: fold a piece of paper to create 8 rectangles which will house each of the sketches you create in 30-60 seconds.

While seemingly simple, I’ve always found it difficult to be vigilant in resisting the urge to settle after the first page of results. Ever wonder what’s on page 2?
