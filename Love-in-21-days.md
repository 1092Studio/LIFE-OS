# How to learn to love in 21 days
## 1. Build a LOVE MAP

Questions you need to answer to see if it's for you?
1. Do you spend a lot of your time with someone you know changes in ways that they can't recognize but you know would make them happy if you just had an easy way to check in?
2. Do you need help with your next holiday gift? Do you need a gift that can mirror the best of the person and allow them to map it out over time so you can say that you've been working on the gift all week?
3. Do you have a relationship that feels like it's growing a part?
4. Do you need to support your partner who is going through a lot of change but doesn't need your solutions - only asking you to be there and listen. Do you want to show that you're actively listening?
5. Are you looking for a fun couple activity that will allow you to do something every week to both collect, revisit, and strengthen the shared experience of promises you make to each other? Why not have them also include your wishes for each other :)

Well, look no further. This badboy will whip you up a interoperable & always multiplying canvas that will show your partner your perspective of how they're changing...therefore justifying your existence :P Mainly, you want to be able to show your partner that you are able and willing to do what no one else can with the gift of shared time and space: help them see what they're missing & what you remember that they don't.

Plus, seeing that you're both evolving and changing is an important way to always strive to grow together and not a part. Take comfort in the branches that come across your relationship and dare to more than tolerate change over time, thrive in it. More than anything, it's your job to help your partner navigate the track so make sure that you know you have to map it first. If you want to know if you've made a meaningful stride, watch a rally car racing co-driver shout instructions while flying and feeling the bump at 50-100 MPH.....on all terrain. Yes, you have to listen to your partner the entire time.

This draft will end with a hopeful reminder that love is the most potent force in the world. If you want to love, make sure you know that you will be responsible for how your selfishness tugs on your selflessness. It's a tug-of-war and don't worry, you don't have to keep score. Let them win today - hell, maybe even tomorrow - and you'll find that they will come around to make sure that you get a win too. Be willing to lose for the other person to win and be comfortable knowing that you can trust them to not take advantage of it. The way you get yourself and your partner more opportunities to win is make sure that you can see the compounding effect of trust; and if you fail to nurture it: the temporal and transient nature of it.

You should be able to see in 21 days wether or not you get shipped back or if you're going to get shapped up. Good luck, you're going to have a ball!
