# How to learn to love in 21 days


### 1. Into to a LOVE MAP
Questions you need to answer to see if it's for you?/
1. Do you spend a lot of your time with someone you know changes in ways that they can't recognize but you know would make them happy if you just had an easy way to check in?
2. Do you need help with your next holiday gift? Do you need a gift that can mirror the best of the person and allow them to map it out over time so you can say that you've been working on the gift all week?
3. Do you have a relationship that feels like it's growing a part?
4. Do you need to support your partner who is going through a lot of change but doesn't need your solutions - only asking you to be there and listen. Do you want to show that you're actively listening?
5. Are you looking for a fun couple activity that will allow you to do something every week to both collect, revisit, and strengthen the shared experience of promises you make to each other? Why not have them also include your wishes for each other :)

Well, look no further. This badboy will whip you up a interoperable & always multiplying canvas that will show your partner your perspective of how they're changing...therefore justifying your existence :P Mainly, you want to be able to show your partner that you are able and willing to do what no one else can with the gift of shared time and space: help them see what they're missing & what you remember that they don't.

Plus, seeing that you're both evolving and changing is an important way to always strive to grow together and not a part. Take comfort in the branches that come across your relationship and dare to more than tolerate change over time, thrive in it. More than anything, it's your job to help your partner navigate the track so make sure that you know you have to map it first. If you want to know if you've made a meaningful stride, watch a rally car racing co-driver shout instructions while flying and feeling the bump at 50-100 MPH.....on all terrain. Yes, you have to listen to your partner the entire time.

This draft will end with a hopeful reminder that love is the most potent force in the world. If you want to love, make sure you know that you will be responsible for how your selfishness tugs on your selflessness. It's a tug-of-war and don't worry, you don't have to keep score. Let them win today - hell, maybe even tomorrow - and you'll find that they will come around to make sure that you get a win too. Be willing to lose for the other person to win and be comfortable knowing that you can trust them to not take advantage of it. The way you get yourself and your partner more opportunities to win is make sure that you can see the compounding effect of trust; and if you fail to nurture it: the temporal and transient nature of it.

You should be able to see in 21 days wether or not you get shipped back or if you're going to get shapped up. Good luck, you're going to have a ball!

### 2. How do you map out your partner's life if you don't get to do much together?
1. Write letters to each other. Someone might carry the weight but try to catch up.
2. Voice memos on iMessage. These allow you to communicate a lot without the need to coordinate
3. Digital memo on iMessage (drawings). Allows you to bring your strokes & chicken-scratch into hopefully something cute. Don't worry, no one is hanging it on a fridge but someone will be judging your odd ways of writing letters with an accute angle for "is that even a letter?!". Tip: shapes are recommended

### 3. When do you make time to even check out each other's love map?
1. Well, we want this love map to be a transient and condusive of offering new insight into your relationship. For instance, automated counters, lookups, pairing, & time range & time frame functions should be expected out-of-the-box formulas & live recalculations - with visible value from the 2nd use onwards.

### 4. How do you put this into a system that I don't have to remember to do?
1. Worry not friend, if you've got an iPhone you can setup Shortcut Automations so that you can trigger smart automations to occur on triggers like (Texting Lana if you're Archer can automatically remind you "Don't say Danger Zone" - restrictions may apply) OR (When it's this date or time, start running this input form that helps you stich together a long thoughful gift that shows that you're thinking about them all year round)
2. Put it in your school or work calendar. If not, your partner likely already has. Sorry.
3. Consider it your "let's work on this relationship" first Fridays of the month. Once lesson I recently learned from a mother / wife is that saying "I would like you to consider this" sounds a lot better than "you never consider my opinions". The more you do this, the more you realize that your words have power and they'll shape your relationship and partner in ways you can't image. So be concious of the language you use. When all else fails, just create a simple rule like "let's not go to bed mad at each other". That way, you reinforce the systemic, habitual, & intentionally structured nature of showing commitment & dedication to your partner - just don't mention the Shortcuts. Please, don't sell us all out. We let you in on the secret. Be good.
4. Surprise your partner with a surprise holiday b/c you just saw that this time last year you were eating out Sushi and today's sushi day obviously so yea, you just won partner of the year. And you get to each sushi. If you're vegiterian, I recommmend Swedish Fish
