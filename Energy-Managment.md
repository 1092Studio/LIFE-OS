# Intro - Time managment is a fallacy
The best way to make the most of your time is to manage your energy.

# Defining the day into blocks
The most important lesson I've learned from my trading experience is that the time-frame you trade on is the most critical component of your trading analysis. Looking at an asset's price movement on a 30 minute time frame may lead you to make myopic decisions based on choppy or highly variant signals. When you use higher time-frames to trade, like 4 hours, the trends you analyze are a result of more data points that show longer term trends - yielding signals that are more smooth and reliable.

An important metric to measure is the trend over the day and it can be measured in two ways
1. Simple moving average - Treating all of the data points in a time-frame with the same weight
2. Exponential moving average - Weighing recent data with higher value to better capture change in trend, in either direction 
 
24-Hour time blocks:
1. 00:00 - 04:00 : Sleep
2. 04:00 - 08:00 : Sleep
3. 08:00 - 12:00 : Q1
4. 12:00 - 16:00 : Q2
5. 16:00 - 20:00 : Q3
6. 20:00 - 24:00 : Q4

Structuring the day into quarters is  analogous to an earnings report cadence. Further breakdown of the quarter into 4 sections is possible but I find that a 4 hour time-frame is most optimal. Also, there's something magical about starting a new cycle at 00:00 everyday; it feels like a true reset - we all need that!

# Themes
Defining a theme for each block of time is a great way to reduce the number of decisions you have to make within each minute and hour of a 4H quarter.
